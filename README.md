Title: Predicting Electrical Energy Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant

Description:
This project uses machine learning regression techniques to predict the electrical energy output (PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant based on ambient and exhaust parameters. 
The dataset includes variables such as ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and exhaust vacuum. 
The goal is to build and evaluate models that accurately forecast the plantâ€™s power output using real-world sensor data.
